In November 2017 we [reported that more gamblers were opting to "ban" themselves amid a rise in online betting](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41969431). The unit had decided to look at gambling as an issue. This led us to speak to the Gambling Commission and identify some new data which was about to be released.
